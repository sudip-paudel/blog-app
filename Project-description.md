# Project Overview

This project is built using local dummy data and showcases a comprehensive set of features, including:

- **Form Validation**: Implemented using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for robust and type-safe validation.
- **Filtering and Searching**: Users can filter category and tags, and search by title.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Integrated a lexical editor for content creation, supporting **bold**, *italic*, and _underline_ formatting.
- **Data Fetching**: Leveraged [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for efficient and optimized data fetching.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports adding, editing, and deleting posts seamlessly.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Posts load dynamically as users scroll for a smooth browsing experience.
- **State Management**: Utilized [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for simple and scalable state management.
- **UI Styling**: Designed with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a responsive and modern user interface.

This project demonstrates a clean, maintainable, and fully functional React application with an emphasis on user experience and modern front-end practices.
